Day 1 – July 17  Tthe Schematic Start (4 hours)
So I was just chilling with lo-fi beats on the speaker and scrolling through keyboard setups on Pinterest, and damn those minimal boards just hit different. No RGB naach gaana, no extra keys everywhere. Just that clean, sharp layout and a few clever upgrades. I immediately opened my sketchpad and started roughing out something simple and elegant. Not overkill, but still solid for daily typing and coding. I knew I wanted rotary encoders on the top right, because volume and scrolling should be knob-controlled, bro. Also, an OLED screen for some nice touch—a clock, layer display, or even a little animation. The main layout was around 65%, but cleaner—no extra gaps, no clutter.

Then I jumped into EasyEDA and started building out the schematic. I laid down the Pro Micro clone first like always, it's the backbone. Next, I placed a 9-row, 6-column matrix. Switches all got diodes 1N4148s, standard. I used SW footprints labeled neatly and began routing each row and column connection logically. Took time, but I wanted it to be sahi from the start. Ended the night with the first version of the schematic mostly wired. Phew, brain fried but excited.
