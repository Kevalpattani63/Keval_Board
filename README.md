# Aesthetic Keyboard 
Minimal 65% custom keyboard with dual encoders, OLED.

---

It all started when I was bored of the flashy, RGB-overloaded prebuilt boards. I didnâ€™t want anything too loud or gamer coded just a clean, minimal board that I could carry, code on, or chill and type without distractions. So one night, while playing around on EasyEDA, I decided to just go for it.I started off by drafting a clean schematic. Nothing fancyâ€”just sixty-something keys, standard matrix setup, and a few extras. I placed footprints for 61 hot-swap switches, 1N4148 diodes, and rotary encoders on the right. I also added an OLED screen bang in the middle top so I could use it to show layers, typing speed, or whatever random pixel art I wanted.

Once the schematic was locked, I poured around 5 hours laying out the PCB manually. I kept the traces tidy, respected the row-column rules, and made sure the diodes werenâ€™t flippedâ€”because trust me, debugging that later is a headache. I used the Pro Micro as the brain again, because itâ€™s affordable and works well with QMK. For extra support, I added mounting holes around the edges, just in case I decide to go screw-mount later. Once done, I exported the Gerbers and sent the board off to JLCPCB with a matte black solder mask. It cost me peanuts for 5 boards.

This board has a solid layout that feels like a cross between a 65% and a productivity board. I kept the encoder knobs top right theyâ€™re handy for media, volume, or layer switching. The OLED is 0.91" and uses IÂ²C, wired directly to SDA/SCL on the Pro Micro. Itâ€™s compact, but adds a lot of charm. Just seeing something on screen makes the board feel alive.

## 3D Printed Case

For the enclosure, I opened up Fusion 360 and made a simple two-part shellâ€”just a base and a low-profile top. I left cutouts for the encoders and OLED, and slots on the side for USB access

# updated Case

ive added a cool pattern for base , and added a secret code on top which says keval is cool

- Layer 0: Standard QWERTY
- Layer 1: Media controls, encoder scroll
- Layer 2: Function + macros
